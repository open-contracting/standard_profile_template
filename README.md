# OCDS Profile Template

## Getting started

1. [Create a repository](https://github.com/organizations/open-contracting/repositories/new) from this template
1. [Configure the repository](https://ocdsdeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy/docs.html#publish-draft-documentation)
1. Clone the repository
1. Replace `TODO` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `docs/conf.py`, `docs/index.md`, `schema/profile/extension.json`
1. Replace the content of the readme with `Read this profile at <https://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/TODO/latest/en/>`
1. Commit your changes
1. [Configure robots.txt to allow access to the profile's documentation](https://ocdsdeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy/docs.html#add-a-new-profile)

### Updating build-related files

Periodically update the stable files across the standard and profiles:

```shell
./script/update
```

Periodically compare the configurable files to the template's files:

```shell
